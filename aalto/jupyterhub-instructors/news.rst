jupyter.cs news
===============

Spring 2024
-----------

* We had a user's group meeting.  You can find the `slides here
  <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BySO0EzOeUT4uTdd2_5kkqLAShYdVqo2h2tGlz5OpHg/edit>`__,
  including commentary.
* :doc:`/help/garage` now has a focus day for jupyter.cs on Wednesdays.

Autumn 2023
-----------

* JupyterLab is now available and is the default
  for new course servers. If you'd like to continue
  using Jupyter Notebook for your courses, let us know
  when requesting a new course.  JupyterLab now supports
  everything nbgrader needs, though the user interface is
  slightly different.  You can send
  :doc:`../jupyterhub/nbgrader-jupyterlab` to your students for
  instructions.

Summer/Autumn 2020
------------------

* You can now make a direct link that will spawn a notebook server,
  for example for a course with a slug of ``testcourse``:
  ```https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/hub/spawn?profile=testcourse``
  If the user is already running a server, it will **not switch
  to the new course**.  Expect some subtle confusion with this.  Full
  info in :doc:`faq-hints`.

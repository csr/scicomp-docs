For units such as departments, schools, or flagship projects
============================================================

Computing is everywhere: in almost every unit of every field of
research.  But computing is often hard, and not everyone can do what
they need to alone.  Advanced computing needs to be a team effort, and
we can help with that.

Aalto Research Software Engineers (RSE) is part of Science-IT, the
Aalto University infrastructure for scientific and high-performance
computing.  Science-IT is a virtual organization in Aalto, and your
unit can join by hiring staff to serve with us.



Proposal in brief
-----------------

Aalto Science-IT is a research infrastructure, and part of it is Aalto
Research Software Engineers.  Our job is to make computing possible
for everyone.  We have some ability to serve all Aalto, but this is
limited.

Your unit can reach the next level of computing and AI based research
by supporting its staff with Research Software Engineers.  This will
allow your research community to do better science, faster, and more
reproducible.  You'll waste less time on solved problems.

You can fully join the RSE team by hiring (or finding
internally) some staff interested in research software and scientific
computing.  They'll join our team, taking full advantage of our
knowledge and resources, while focusing on your own unit's problems.



What do research software engineers do?
---------------------------------------

What do you need to do with computing, but your staff currently
struggle with?  It depends on your unit's needs, but in general
activities include:

- Consulting with project's small problems (solve problems faster and
  save time)
- Writing and supporting software, when the software isn't the main
  goal of the research
- Keeping data organized
- Port code and manage workflows on supercomputers
- Finalizing projects and making nice interfaces for the public to
  view.
- Manage automation and workflows: reach a larger scale.
- Assist in planning for research ethics evaluations and data
  management.
- See our :doc:`portfolio <portfolio>` for more examples of real
  projects.

**Previous measurements have shown that RSEs are a good investment: an
hour of our time usually saves 5 hours of researcher's time or more**.
We also make new projects possible, which couldn't be done otherwise.
Aalto RSE's biggest impact is speeding up and improving lots of small
projects, but we usually have some longer projects going on, too.

   One way of looking at the types of projects a RSE can do.  Note we
   do anything from providing advice to speed up other projects to
   doing projects ourselves, where an academic can't.



How it can work
---------------

**Aalto Science-IT (and thus Aalto RSE) is a university-level research
infrastructure.  It operates as a virtual team: in principle, it's
easy for your staff to join.**  Here's how we would go about it:

First, think of where such a person can be situated.  Are they hired
at the school level?  Department?  Service staff or academic staff?
Job title?  All of these can be adapted to what makes the most sense
for your school.

   At the School of Science our arrangement is:

   - Have hired at the school level as Technical Services
   - Full time and permanent
   - Job title "Research Engineer", business title "Research Software
     Engineer".
   - Service staff with regular working hours.
   - Funded from school and department budgets.  Research projects
     also directly contribute funding via Halli for their share of the
     work.

As for the actual hiring, you might already have someone internal who
is interested in a focus shift.  For new hires Aalto Research Software
Engineers can help with recruitment.  We can suggest good candidates
from our recruitment calls - we get many good candidates from various
schools.

Your new hire would begin in your school, but initially spend time
working with Aalto RSE.  They can join our support and training
sessions and learn the tools of our trade, while focusing on your own
unit's problems.  This is the way we onboard people to computational
support.  See the `RSE work rotations
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/blog/2024/rse-work-rotations/>`__ blog
post for more info.

After some time, your staff may split off into its own team, or they
might continue operating as part of the Aalto-wide team.  We'll discuss
and see what is best for you.  Some continued collaboration is best,
because a large team has the most knowledge to draw on.

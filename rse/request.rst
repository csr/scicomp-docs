Requesting RSE support
======================

You can contact us regardless of how small your issue is - or even if
you would like to know if we could help your project.  At least, we
can point you in the right direction.



Quick Consultations
-------------------

We recommend you come to our daily :ref:`garage sessions
<scicomp-garage>` for a short chat.  There are no reservations, and
this is the online equivalent of dropping by our office to say hi.



Contact
-------

We recommend you come to our daily :ref:`garage sessions
<scicomp-garage>` (see above), rather than send email (or to come by
after you send the email).  We almost always have more questions and
want to chat, so that responding to email is slow.

Our email is rse@aalto.fi (the Triton email address
scicomp@aalto.fi also gets to us). You can also use the `structured request
form <https://selfservice.esupport.aalto.fi/ssc/app#/order/2026/>`__
("Research Software Engineer request").  This guides you through some
of our initial questions, but goes to the same place as email and
everything is read by a human anyway.

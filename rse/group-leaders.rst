For group leaders
=================

You, or someone in your group, has requested :doc:`Research Software
Engineer <../index>` services for one of your group's projects.  This
service provides specialist support for software, data, and open
science so that you can focus on the science that is interesting to
you.  You probably have some questions about what this is, and this
page will answer those practical questions.  For researchers using our
services, also see :doc:`how-we-work`.



How it is funded
----------------
There are two funding strategies:

* Short term (a few weeks or less) is funded by your department, if
  you are in one of the :doc:`sponsoring units <units>`.  You don't
  need to do anything special.
* Longer term (month or more) is funded from your own projects.  See
  the information for :doc:`grant applicants <grant-applicants>`, it
  is also relevant if you already have funding you want to use.

  You can use our services for both a specific project, or generally
  have us around on retainer to support all of your projects (for
  example, 20% time for a year).  If you are applying for a new grant,
  see :doc:`grant-applicants`.



Access to data and tools
------------------------

Our goal is not to come in, wave our hands, and leave you with
something unusable.  Instead, we want to come in and set you up to
work yourself in the future.  Thus, (if it's necessary) we'll want the
same access to your group's data/workspace/tools as you have.

This access is removed after the project is finished.  We will try to
remember this, but sometimes projects drag on with no clear ending (or
you want long-term consultation), so you should also pay attention to
this.  Out of principle (+ policies), we access the data the same as a
normal researcher would.



NDAs, intellectual property, etc.
---------------------------------

The RSE staff are Aalto employees and are automatically bound to
confidentiality, and have signed the same extra confidentiality
agreement that Aalto IT system administrators have, and are similarly
vetted.

Using our services doesn't affect your intellectual property right any
more than another employee working on the project will.  This is
service-for-pay, so you get all rights.  However, our RSEs expect to
be acknowledged according to good scientific practice (see
:doc:`how-we-work`).

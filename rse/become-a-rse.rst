     learn how they work.

This page guides people into the interesting world of
research software engineering: providing a view to what this career is
like, and what you could do if you want to develop your skills.
**This isn't what you have to know to start off.  It's a map of ideas
for both before and after, not a list of requirements.**

If (some of) the following apply to you, you are a good candidate:

* I like the academic environment, but don't want to focus just on
  making publications.
* I am reasonably good at some programming concepts, and am eager to
  learn more.  I know one language well, can shell script, and
  generally familiar with Linux.
* I am interested in going to a scientist-developer kind of role in a
  company, but need more experience before I can make the transition.



Components of RSE skills
------------------------

1. **Research practices:** Research is its own special thing, with
   special ways of working (this includes data management and open
   science).  Research experience helps you connect to our target
   audience and know what works and doesn't.

2. **Programming and software development:** Programming and general
   development and project management practices are important - but we
   must keep in mind the relatively small-scale nature of our
   projects.  Basics are useful, enterprise-grade usually isn't.

3. **Open-source/open-project knowledge:** We emphasize making
   research results reusable, and open source practices are a key way
   to do that.

A person coming from a research background will be probably be good at (1) but
likely need to improve more in (2).  Someone coming from an industry
background will probably be good at (2) but need to improve in
(1).  (3) is very person-dependent.

Let's not forget a final

4. **Mentoring and teaching:** As in every job, social skills are the
   most important aspect, since you are working closely with a wide
   variety of researchers.



Research practices
------------------

To get experience with this, there is a fairly clear academic career
path which can provide good RSE education, especially if you look
beyond producing as many papers as possible.  To broaden your skills,
try:

- Try to get involved in a wide variety of computing, data, and
  software related research.
- Publish datasets and software (properly) along with your papers -
  either separately or in a software/data paper.
- Try to work on more collaborative projects (sharing code/data),
  rather than focusing on your own work.
- Manage your data well (remember, it's not just about the software).
- Use different types of computing environments for your work,
  especially cluster environments (see our :ref:`HPC cluster lessons
  <tutorials>`).



Software development
--------------------

Technical skills are an important part of what we do: computing, data,
and software.  Many people attend basic programming courses, but there are
many important practices beyond that: version control, other tools,
methods (Scrum, agile, etc), deployment strategies, and so on.

Don't let "software" trick you into under-valuing other forms of
skills: data managers, computational specialists, etc are all
important, too.

To develop these skills, try:

- Get at least minimally comfortable with the command line.
- Use version control (at the right level for your project).  Can you
  make your project a bit more professional and level up your version
  control?
- Add a command line interface to a code.
- Make a modular, reusable code.
- Add automated tests, continuous integration.
- Play with a new language or tool for some small project - do you
  have experience in both high and low level languages?
- Automate your workflow to make it reproducible.
- Use the best data storage methods possible.
- Make a merge request / pull request to a project you want to
  contribute to.
- `CodeRefinery workshops <https://coderefinery.org>`__ cover most of
  what you need.
- Look at the :doc:`Zen of Scientific Computing
  </scicomp/zen-of-scicomp>` for other ways to advance some projects
  up those levels.



Open source / open project knowledge
------------------------------------

One of our most important goals is to make research reusable and more
open.  For computational research, the practices of open-source
projects are our main toolbox, since they are often shareable and
reusable by design.  Don't limit your vision to just software
projects, for example Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap are open projects
focused on data curation.

To develop these skills, try:

- On Github, subscribe to a project of interest to you.  See how it is
  run.  (see if you find some that are large enough to use best
  practices and active communication, but not so large there is a
  flood of messages).  Or, subscribe to some mailing lists of the
  project.
- Report issues and try to help debug a project of interest to you.
- Make a contribution to a project of interest to you.
- Package and release one of your projects...
- ... and see if you can get others to use it.
- Help others use some of your tools.



Mentoring and teaching
----------------------

The job of a RSE, at least in our vision, is as much mentoring and
teaching others as it is doing things.  To improve this, you could
try:

- Mentor younger researchers in computational tools.
- Become the "local computational expert" in your group.
- Teach someone about how to use a tool you use.
- Help teach some relevant courses.
- `How to help someone use a computer by Phil Agre
  <https://www.librarian.net/stax/4965/how-to-help-someone-use-a-computer-by-phil-agre/>`__
- `Motivation and demotivation
  <https://teachtogether.tech/#s:motivation>`__, a chapter in Teaching
  Tech Together.
- Check out and get involved in being an exercise leader/co-instructor
  at `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`__.



Role at Aalto
-------------

At least at Aalto, you will:

* Provide software development and consulting as a service, depending
  on demand from research groups.
* Provide one-on-one research support from a software, programming,
  Linux, data, and infrastructure perspective: short-term projects
  helping researchers with specific tasks, so that the researchers
  gain competence to work independently.
* As needed and desired, teach and provide other research support.
* A typical cycle involves evaluating potential projects,
  meeting, formulating a work plan, co-working to develop a solution,
  teaching and mentoring for skill development, and follow-up.

All will be done as part of a team to round out skills and continuous
internal knowledge-sharing.

Skillset
--------

Below, we have a large list of the types of technologies which are valued
by our researchers and useful to our RSEs.  **No one person is expected to
know everything, but we
will hire a variety of people to cover many of the things you see
here.**

Most important is *do you want to learn things from this list?  Can
you do so mostly independently but with the help of a great team?*



.. admonition:: More detailed list of relevant skills
   :class: dropdown

   This was an older long list of relevant skills.  This is
   inspiration, not a list of things you must know.  No one knows all
   of these when they start off.

   General tech skills: Our broad background on which we build:

   * Basic mandatory skills include Linux, shell scripting, some
     low-level programming language (C, Fortran), and programming in
     several more languages (Python particularly advantageous).
   * Good knowledge of computer clusters, batch systems, and
     high-performance computing.
   * Any additional programming, workflow, research, or system tools are
     a plus.  You should have a wide range of skills, but the exact
     skills are not so important.  Most important is sufficient fluency
     to pick up anything quickly.  These skills should be listed as an
     appendix to the cover letter if not included in the CV.
   * Advanced parallel programming skills are a plus, but equally
     important is the ability to create good, simple, practical tools.
   * Git, GitHub, git-based collaborative workflows.
   * Software testing, CI, documentation, reproducible, portability, etc.
   * As an example, the ideal candidate will have near-perfect knowledge
     of all `Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>`__, `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org/lessons/>`__, and the generic parts of
     our :ref:`HPC lessons <tutorials>` - or be able to fill in gaps with
     minimal effort.
   * But at the same time, we don't just want people from purely
     computational backgrounds.  You'll work with people from
     experimental sciences, digital humanities, etc, and good people from
     these backgrounds are important, too.
   * A good attitude towards mentoring and teaching and an ability to
     explain complex subjects in an accessible way.
   * Commitment to diversity and equality of researchers among many
     different backgrounds.
   * Good knowledge of English.  Finnish is advantageous but not required,
     our internal working language is English.


   Specific examples: This is a selection of advanced skills which are
   useful (remember, this is what you might learn, not what you
   already know):

   * Advanced experience of debugging/profiling/developing Linux tools,
     including Git, Intel and GNU compiler suits and corresponding tools.
   * Software building tools like Make, CMake and alike.
   * Advanced knowledge of parallel programming models, experience of
     parallel programming (OpenMP, MPI).
   * Advanced GPU computing / programming (CUDA, OpenACC, OpenMP models),
     experience of porting software to GPUs.
   * Profiling and optimization - both of low-level languages and
     high-level.
   * Knowledge of scientific software and packages including Matlab,
     Mathematica, Python libs, others is beneficial.
   * Experimental data collection, LabView, etc.
   * Workflow automation, shell scripting, porting from single machines
     to clusters.
   * Docker, Singularity, containers.
   * Data analysis tools like R, Python, pandas, numpy, etc. are
     beneficial.
   * Julia, Matlab, Mathematica.
   * Web development, cloud operations.
   * Scientific Computing on other operating systems.

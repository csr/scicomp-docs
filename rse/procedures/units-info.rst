Unit information
================

This page describes the Aalto units which are supporting the RSE
program and what their priorities are.

The service is currently (early 2023) mainly funded by the School of
Science, with a grant from IT Services to allow use through all of Aalto.

See :doc:`../units` if you would like to join the RSE service as a
department or school.

FCAI
----

FCAI sponsors several research software engineers, who both do general
work and targeted work.  In effect, FCAI projects get a
higher priority and management sends some strategic projects to us for
intense support.


Rest of Aalto
-------------
IT Services provides a grant to support research in all of Aalto.

If you project has its own funding, we *can* support it.  And the
:doc:`/help/garage` support is always available.

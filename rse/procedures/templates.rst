might expect, they are probably not suitable for using directly (even
by us), but it's better to record them than lose them, and better to
be open than not.

.. collapse:: Infrastructures

   Did you know of the Aalto Research Software Engineer service
   (https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/)?  It provides specialized support
   in software development and computational science.  Could any of
   your infrastructure users benefit from this service?

   The point of this service is to make sure that anyone can succeed
   in their service, regardless of their computational background.
   For example, we can provide software development, advice and
   support for those programming themselves, data management support,
   help packaging and publish software, and so on.  There are so many
   things that a person needs to know these days that one can't
   expect to know everything.

   We started in 2020 in the School of Science, and now have funding
   to support people from any school.

   If you have any ideas, feel free to point your users to our
   service, https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/ .  Or, we can arrange a
   discussion session to talk about ways to more closely work
   together, since I am sure there are ways that joining forces is
   best.


Project status (waiting)
------------------------

.. collapse:: In the queue

   We (Aalto RSE) still have an open issue in our queue about your
   project DESCRIPTION.

   It's still in our queue, and hopefully someone can get to it in
   WHEN.  I'm wondering about status from your side - Is this still
   important to you?  Have you figured out something else already, so
   that it's not needed?  Anything we should know about our scheduling
   and planning?  Should we increase/reduce the priority?  Would some
   smaller amount of help let you get going?

   For short term stuff and consultations about the project, you can
   always try dropping by our garage, even before we actively start
   working: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/

Feedback

.. collapse:: Feedback requests

   Hi,

   Some time ago, we helped you with ________________ as part of our
   Research Software Engineer service.  Now that some
   time has passed, we would like to know if you had any feedback on
   our support.  This is very important to us to ensure the
   continuation of this service, so please take a minute or two to
   quickly answer!  A few numbers in reply to this message is
   sufficient.

   First off, we wonder how much time (mental effort) do you think our
   work has saved you?  (We know this can be hard to estimate, but any
   kind of rough prediction of "I avoided spending X days/hours to
   plan, implement, or debug what we would have done otherwise".)

   Then, what about these research outputs: how many have we
   contributed to?: Articles/papers, datasets, software projects
   released, projects supported in general, etc.

   Do you have any other comments on our service?

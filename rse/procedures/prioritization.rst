Project prioritization
======================

This page describes the types of projects we have and the general
principles of how we prioritize them.  This doesn't exactly say how
things are prioritized (there are too many)



Types of projects
-----------------

* Size ``G`` (for "garage"): the smallest projects, handled within the
  :doc:`daily garage </help/garage>`.  A few hours and not scheduled,
  they are handled as people come to garage.  Entered in the garage
  diary, but not the rse-projects tracker.
* Size ``S`` ("small"): <= 1-2 days.
* Size ``M`` ("medium"): <= 1 month.
* Size ``L`` ("large"): > 1 month.  These are generally paid by the
  projects themselves.

RSE staff that are fully funded from a certain project out outside the
system of this page, and work on the projects as decided by their
funders.



Prioritization
--------------

G projects usually get priority, but that is because they are drop-in
and not scheduled.  Whoever is available will help (usually the same
person but who knows).  We help for a reasonable amount of time
(depending on need and busyness) for each drop-in session.  A session
ends with the problem solved, a request to come back the next day, or
an upgrade to an S-level project.

S projects are often used as fillers during downtime in other
projects.  We often have a general priority list, but the actual start
time can be a bit uncertain.

M projects are sort of in the middle.  They are scheduled when
possible, but since they aren't paid by the research groups the work
might be more intermittent.

L projects, being paid by a particular group, usually get priority.
However, often time there is downtime during these, which are used for
other projects.

Some research groups provide "retainer" funding: long-term funding
without a specific L-size project.  Their funding is used for whatever
S and M projects come up, and those S and M projects get a much higher
priority (of course, depending on the urgency of the project itself).

There are two main steps in our prioritization:

* General discussions during the weekly team meetings.
* Each RSE's evaluation of each project, based on their knowledge of
  the work, the time they have, and what the benefit will be.

Per-project prioritization factors:

* Self-evaluation of usefulness and importance by the researchers
* Benefit to open science and broader strategic impact
* Long-term impact to research (for example, improved skills or use of
  tools)
* Priority for units which provide funding
* Diversity and balance, including diversity goals.

RSE financial practicalities
============================

Let's say you :doc:`know what we do <../index>` and have funding and
would like to send it our way.  This page says what to do.  You can
read :doc:`what we know about different funders
<../grant-applicants>`, but it's probably better to ask your
controller directly if you have the funding already.



Instructions for group leaders
------------------------------

Please send a message such as this one to your controllers (we will
tell you the relevant salary):

    I am wondering what types of funding I have available to cover
    salary at [NNNN]â‚¬/month (Aalto internal, SCI) - do I have enough
    funding for [1 month / 5 days / 4 months at 25% / etc.] at this
    level?  I would like to hire one of the Aalto Research Software
    Engineers for a short amount of time for a project.  You can read
    more here:

    * https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/procedures/finance-practicalities/#instructions-for-department-controller
    * https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/

If the answer is positive and you want to start the process, reply and
include Richard Darst, the Research Software Engineer, and the RSE
controller that we indicate:

    The person is [USERNAME/EMAIL].  They can be added to Halli and
    they will directly allocate their salary to this project based on
    time worked.  Please also let us know any requirements (maximum
    amount of time, valid months, etc.)  Richard Darst (cc:ed) can
    answer any more questions about this.

    (Costs can also be paid by internal charging, if that is easier.)

Checklist:

* Project discussed with researcher (and research software engineer,
  if relevant)
* Decide how time will be spent

  * Bill time to the Halli project whenever needed (flexible, but
    total cost is unknown and specific time isn't reserved in advance)
  * Schedule xx% time for a certain time period (fixed cost, but it
    may not match up with the pace of your project)

* Initial request sent to your controller to confirm funds are
  available
* Request for setup sent to your controller, RSE controller, RSE lead
  (Richard Darst).
* Details relayed back to RSE lead / research software engineer.



Instructions for junior researchers
-----------------------------------

Below is an example message to send to your group leader, if you need
some inspiration:

    Dear GROUP LEADER, as you know I have been going to the SciComp
    garage to get help from the Aalto Scientific Computing people.  We
    are at the point that they would like to help more, and our group
    has already reached the limit of the free "research software
    engineer" service, which goes beyond the typical cluster support.
    Do you think we have a little bit of funding which would allow us
    to hire their services for a short period?

    With a little bit of funding, we can make our work much better and
    faster, and {we will accomplish [goals] / I [won't have to worry
    about [topic] / will learn about [topic] much faster]}.

    You can read more about the service here:
    https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/

Checklist:

* Project discussed with research software engineer
* Request sent to supervisor



Instructions for department controller
--------------------------------------

Our Research Software Engineer (RSE) will work on a project for the PI
according to the PI's requests and be paid by their project.  Usually,
the RSE will track the time they spend and record the actual time used
for the project in Halli. If it's easier for you, salaries can be
handled by internal charging.  Our team's controllers are in
SCI-Common.

Checklist:

* Name staff (RSE) and duration of funding received.
* Confirm funding conditions.
* If using Halli:

  * RSE added to the correct Halli projects by department controller
    (add permission for staff to record hours to the project).
  * Project number and any additional constraints (maximum hours,
    funding deadline, etc.) sent to the RSE, RSE lead (Richard Darst),
    and PI.

* If using internal charging:

  * Arranged between department controller and RSE controller (SCI)
  * We'll track our time internally.

* If an EU project or any special constraints on how we keep our
  records, let us know.  EU projects use Halli strictly, as
  described on the :ref:`project administration page, heading "special
  projects" <rse-project-admin-types-of-projects>`.

* Tell us how to update this page to be more useful to others.

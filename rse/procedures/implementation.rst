Implementation (2020 plan)
==========================

.. admonition:: About this page

   This is our tentative implementation plan, as of August 2020.  It
   is always subject to revision, but is a somewhat controlled
   document.


About
-----

Researcher Software Engineers provide specialized scientific computing
and data management support to researchers, beyond what is currently
offered by Science-IT. Their funding is guaranteed by
departments/schools/other units, but after the ramp-up phase most
funding is expected to come from the research projects themselves.

Services include, for example, software development, scaling up or
optimizing computations, taking new technologies into use, and in
general promoting best practices in new and existing research using
computational methods.



Funding types and sources
-------------------------

Funding has three types:

- **Ramp-up/Guarantee (R/G):** Ramp-up funding to do initial hires,
  until project funding takes over

  - Ramp-up: department/schools/other units allocate a certain amount
    of money to do hires.

  - Units which provide Ramp-up/guarantee get first priority for their
    projects.

  - *Replaced* with project funding (below), if there are no projects
    then used for basic services (below).

- **Project (P):** External or group money, allocated by a PI for a
  specific task in their group.

- **Basic (B):** Allocated from units for short-term basic service for
  all of its members.

  - Allows short, strategic assistance without microtransactions

  - **Science-IT** work is a type of basic work, but may be requested
    by the Science-IT team instead of the researchers themselves.
    (For example, Science-IT has a long list of inefficient
    hardware use and inefficient software practices which can keep
    RSEs occupied for a long time. RSEs can also work on
    Triton/scientific computing technical development projects,
    which helps RSEs gain competence for the rest of their tasks.)



Time allocation principles
--------------------------

- We track time spent per unit. Fairshare algorithm: the unit with the
  largest "deficit" in time gets priority for upcoming projects.

- Units which provide ramp-up/guarantee funding get priority for their
  projects.

- Project funding replaces ramp-up/guarantee funding.

- Time paid from basic funding is allocated to tasks within the unit
  with the greatest strategic benefit, for example helping an
  entire group to use better tools or fixing extreme waste of
  resources.

- When a group provides project funding, they can decide the tasks the
  RSE will do.



Ramp-up plan
------------

This is a rough estimate of the type of demand we expect:

+-----------------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+
| Distribution of work        |                                                    |
+=============================+===========+========+========+========+=============+
|                             | 2020 H2   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | Long-term   |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+
| FTE                         | 2         | 2–3    | 3–4    | 3–5    | 4+          |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+
| Project work                | 20%       | 50%    | 60%    | 70%    | 70%         |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+
| Basic work for units        | 50%       | 40%    | 30%    | 20%    | 20%         |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+
| Basic work for Science-IT   | 30%       | 10%    | 10%    | 10%    | 10%         |
+-----------------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+

- Our initial survey reached only Triton users and had 40 responses, of
  them 60% said "quick consultation", 60% said "short term, 1–2
  days", 40% said "medium term, weeks to months".

- Actual ramp-up depends on funding cycles, research timing, and human
  psychology.



Start-up funding (already guaranteed)

Funding practicalities
----------------------

Principle: the daily rate is roughly equal to "senior postdoc/staff
scientist" salary + overheads.

Principle: When working for a research project, the RSEs record those
working hours in Halli to that project. The corresponding portion of the
salary is then automatically charged to the project. Remaining hours are
recorded to the Dean's unit RSE project, and once a year we split
these costs and send them to each department.  [Updated 2020-11-05]

Measurement and KPIs
--------------------

- Number of projects and researchers who have been given support
- *Number of researcher-days saved*, as estimated by our customers.
- Fraction of project funding vs total program funding



Communication
-------------

- Units which fund us will be informed of our activities at least every
  6 months.

- "As open as possible, as closed as necessary". All RSE program data,
  documents, and statistics will be public, excluding actual
  project funding and information from the customers.



Risks and ramp-down
-------------------

- Primary risk: making permanent hires, yet not being able to sustain
  the program long-term.

  - Mitigation: we will only hire RSEs which can be absorbed into
    Science-IT naturally should the need of this service fade
    away.

- Risk: difficulty in reaching researchers and explaining what we do

  - Mitigation: Science-IT has a long list of researchers who are
    using research services inefficiently: they can be contacted
    directly to inform about this service. Helping them and
    producing best practice examples for the future can keep
    several people busy for years.

- Risk: Researchers see need, but group leaders unwilling to pay

  - This is indeed a risk, but there is precedence from other
    countries that there are enough people willing to pay. There
    will likely be a slow start, but as time goes on, expenses
    incurred by this service can directly be written into the
    budget of funding applications.

In our ramp-down strategy, we absorb the RSEs into Science-IT, CS-IT as
part of its development efforts, or into other existing teams.

Research Software Engineers
===========================

The Aalto `Research Software Engineers <rse-history_>`_ (RSEs) provide
specialist support regarding
software, computing, and data. As research becomes more digital and
computer-dependent, the prerequisite knowledge grows larger and
larger, and we exist to help you fill that gap.

For anything related to **custom software development, computational
research, data management, workflow automation, scaling-up, deployment
of public previews,
collaborative work, reproducible research, optimization,
high-performance computing, and more**, we can:

* **Do it for you:** You need some custom technical
  software/solution.  We do it for you, you get straight to your work.
* **Do it with you:** We co-work with your group, teaching while we go
  along.
* **Make it reusable:** You already have something, but it doesn't
  work for others.
* **Plan your ambitions:** Figure out how far you can reach in your
  next project or grant.

Instead of, or in addition to, hiring your own intern, postdoc,
etc. to struggle with
certain issues, we can help you. Our working groups consist of experienced
researchers who have broad experience with scientific computing
(programming, computing, data) for our academic work, and thus can
seamlessly collaborate on research projects. We can also do
consultation and training. You will have more
impact since your work will become more reusable, open, and of a higher quality. We
can work on your ongoing projects, or you can add us directly into your next
grant application.

**Service availability:** Garage support is available to researchers
at Aalto.
We serve projects from all Aalto schools thanks to IT Services grants,
but our main funding currently comes from the School of Science.  For
more information, see :doc:`procedures/units-info`.

This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
:doc:`scientific computing in practice sessions </training/scip/index>` and
`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`_.  If you want a kickstart
to put those lessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.

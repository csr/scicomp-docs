Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series at Aalto University and Aalto Data Agents RDM training.

**Audience:** Anyone who works with personal data in all its forms (background variables from questionnaires, medical images, health data, geospatial location data, speech, videos, pictures, etc...).

**About the course:** The goals for this course are practical: to have people to actually de-identify/pseudo-anonymise/anonymize personal data in many of its forms and also use modern techniques for working with personal / sensitive data.

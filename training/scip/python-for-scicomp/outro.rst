How can we work together
------------------------
* Individual contributor

  * Team leader / bring your group
  * Co-teacher
  * Help out in general: there is plenty to do other than teaching,
    and that's our current problem!

* Individual contributor as part of an organization

  * Advertise our course to your audience
  * Run local breakout rooms /exercise sessions
  * All of the above.

* As an organization

  * Become a partner, do all of the above systematically and for a
    long-term period.
  * We want CodeRefinery to become a partnership and maybe incorporate
    as a non-profit.
  * All of the above.



Follow-up
---------

* Afterparty in Zoom :)

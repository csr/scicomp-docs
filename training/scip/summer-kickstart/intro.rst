   This is the initial intro of the kickstart course

Summer Kickstart intro
======================



What is this course?
--------------------


Course contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Day 1

  * General big-picture stuff about high-performance computing
  * Some practical skills
  * Mostly lectures and demos
  * Quite generic

* Days 2 and 3

  * Using a computer cluster
  * Aalto's cluster as an example, but applicable to others.
  * Much more hands-on


Who is attending?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Multiple universities, with *different clusters*
* Our demos based on Aalto University

  * May need adapting to other sites
  * We will carefully explain about how things change in other sites.


Who are we?
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Aalto Scientific Computing: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/about/
* In collaborations with other universities (Finnish Computing
  Competence Infrastructure)
* And one talk in collaboration with CSC




Practicalities
--------------


How the workshop works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When some people teach online, they can reach a few tens of people at
once.  We can reach hundreds.

We have an interesting strategy:

- Livestream broadcast, like a TV production.
- Anyone can watch.
- There are pauses for exercises, you can work (alone or in groups).
- If you want, be in Zoom and switch there for exercise sessions.

There are many parts of the workshop:

- Talking and demos (livestream)
- Type-along (livestream)
- Exercises (Zoom or alone or your own groups)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour


Chat and communication
----------------------

- Please don't use the Zoom chat for questions: who can keep track?

  - Instructors won't see
  - But you can for practical questions

- Use HackMD for chat: questions in bullet points:

  .. image:: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png
     :alt: View and edit modes at top

- From here you can also find important links and reference.

- You can switch between view and edit modes:

     :alt: View and edit modes at top

  - You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you
    can go back to view)
  - Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- Someone watches these and will answer or raise relevant questions by
  voice.

- Don't get overloaded!  The point is you can read later.

- **Don't include names or identifies in HackMD: it is public.**

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in HackMD**


Where do you focus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is so much information!  What should we look?

- **Screenshare and lecture**
- **Your own type-along**
- **HackMD (all important links should be pasted here)**

  - Only look at the bottom.
  - Come back and read detailed answers later, not during.

- Lesson webpage (as needed, direct links in HackMD)


Screen arrangement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arranging your screen is surprisingly difficult!

- We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for demos.
- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" (in the settings) gives you two *windows*
  which might be useful.

There is more than one way to take this course
----------------------------------------------

- We have more material than we can cover

  - We adjust to the audience
  - Some is advanced, we leave it for self-study

- Not everyone needs to take the same path

  - Some may prefer to watch and self-study later
  - Some may be active in all the exercises
  - Some may leave it on in the background to see what they might
    learn.

- Our material is constantly being improved

  - This is more like a guided overview of our actual tutorials than a
    standalone course.
  - You can help us improve.



Care for the community
----------------------

Be respectful and helpful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is actually hard to teach and mentor for tech like this.  The
course is much more than "only" instructors..

We leave you with four pieces of advice for now:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- **Everyone is both a teacher and a learner.**  If not now, after the
  course when you are helping others.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?", in breakout rooms.
- **When something isn't going right, speak (or HackMD) up quickly**.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".




Final notes
-----------

Recording
~~~~~~~~~

- The course is recorded and will be put on YouTube
- But because of the livestream thing, you *can't* be recorded
  yourself.
- All outputs are CC-BY.


Credits
~~~~~~~

- We don't assign credits for attending this course - we can't track
  attendance.
- Use what you learn here in the online course Hands-on Scientific
  Computing (https://hands-on.coderefinery.org) to get credits.


Join us!
~~~~~~~~

We are staff at Aalto but welcome others to join us in allowing
everyone to do scientific computing.

More on this later.

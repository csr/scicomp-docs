Part of the `Scientific Computing in Practice <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/index.html>`__ lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Researchers who are using or will soon be using R and Python
for data analysis, who know how to program with these languages, but do not
necessarily know what are the best practices for data analysis.
The course material is available in both R and Python, but this
is not a course on the basics of scientific programming. If you wish to
prep up your scientific programming skills, we recommend taking
our :doc:`../scip/python-for-scicomp-2021`-course.

**About the course:** We provide a practical introduction and advice
for data analysis in R and Python. We will learn how you should organize
your workflow, how to organize your data for efficient data analysis, how
to obtain statistics and fit models into your data, and how to think about
scaling your workflow.

The course is suited for people who are starting on doing data analysis
and would like to start on a good workflow.

The exercises can be done with either R or Python.

Course consists of four three hour sessions that will be done online
via zoom. In these sessions we'll learn of core concepts of data analysis.
We will do exercises during the sessions (available via course's
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/data-analysis-workflows-course/>`_).



**Time, date (Europe/Helsinki timezone):**  (`convert 12:00 to your timezone <https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2020-10-05/12:00/Data%20analysis%20workflows#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NjaWNvbXAuYWFsdG8uZmkvdHJhaW5pbmcvc2NpcC9kYXRhLWFuYWx5c2lzLyJ9>`__)

Practical information
---------------------

**Place:**
This is an online course via Zoom (link sent to registered
participants).  The course is also streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes), which is used for asking questions during
the course.  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/data-analysis-workflows-course/>`__.

**Cost:** Free of charge for FGCI consortium members including Aalto
employees and students.

**Registration:** `registration is open
<https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/9F2A504AF3088DBD>`__  (note: Zoom
meeting is full, further registrations will get information on
streaming only)

**Instructors and organizers:** 

* Simo Tuomisto, M. Sc., Aalto Scientific Computing / Department of Computer Science
* Richard Darst Aalto Scientific Computing (coordination)

**Credits:** Credits available for the Aalto students and course
certificate can be provided on request for the outsiders. Full course
hours correspond roughly to 1 ECTS. Students who wish to get a
certificate should hand in the special assignment and participate to
at least 3 of 4 lectures.

Instructions on how to obtain the special assignment can be found at the
Materials-section.

**Preparation**

Software installation is done via conda. Installation instructions are provided
`here <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/data-analysis-workflows-course/installation>`__.

There will be an installation help session on Fri 2.10. between 13:00-15:00.
There we can help you install the required software.

**Additional course info at:** scip -at- aalto.fi


Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__ or R.

**Preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending an online workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-online/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* `The Zoom mechanics we will use
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/>`__, might
  be useful to browse.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.
* Study a bit of Jupyter if you haven't used it before.  The
  `CodeRefinery lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/>`__
  (episode on JupyterLab interface) is enough.

Software installation:

There will be an installation help session on Fri 2.10. between 13:00-15:00.
There we can help you install the required software.

* See the `installation page of the course material
  <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/data-analysis-workflows-course/installation/>`__.  Installation is done via conda.

  * In principle, if you are at Aalto, the service
    https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi should be sufficient to do most of
    this course without any local installations.  Perhaps not
    everything, but it will be OK for most people.  (TODO: we need to
    check this)

* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__.



Community standards
-------------------

This is a large course, and we will have many diverse groups attending
it.  Everyone will be both a teacher and a learner and help to make
the course successful.  Since this is a large and interactive course
which we are just now prototyping, there will be some rough edges and
not everything will go perfectly.  Please learn from our mistakes,
too!

This course consists of both lectures, hands-on exercises, and demos.
It is designed to have a range of basic to advanced topics: there
should be something for everyone.

The main point this course is the exercises, and they will happen in
breakout rooms where we expect people to work together and help each
other.  We expect everyone to help each other as best as they can with
respect for different levels of knowledge - at the same time be aware
of your own limitations.  No one is better than anyone else, we just
have different existing skills and backgrounds.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us* - if you need to contact us
privately, you can message the host on Zoom or :doc:`contact us
outside the course </help/index>`.  This could be as simple as "speak
louder / text on screen is unreadable" or someone is creating a
harmful learning environment.

News and notes
--------------

Week 40:

* Please see the installation instructions (link above).  You need to
  install anaconda *before* the first day, or else you will quickly
  fall behind.  This class is so large that we won't be able to do
  help you catch up.  You should also **verify your installation**
  (this is part of the installation instructions).  On the Friday
  before, we have an installation help session - you can join there
  for help.

* Please remember to join the meeting 10 minutes early.  Our
  icebreakers and introductions already start then.  If you are on
  time, you are late!

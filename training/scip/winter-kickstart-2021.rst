     for details.

Winter Kickstart is a two Ã— half day course for researchers to get
started with the available computational resources at FGCI (Finnish
Grid and Cloud Infrastructure, basically HPC, high-performance
computing, at universities) and CSC (the Finnish national computing
center).  We cover one by one steps on how to get started on the local
computational clusters, from the very basics: learning by doing with
lots of examples and hands-on.

This course is good for any researcher who thinks they may need to
scale up to larger resources in the next six months, in any field.
Even if you don't use computing clusters, you will be better prepared
to understand how computing works on other systems.  If you are a
student, you will invest in your skills.  By the end of the course you
get the hints, ready solutions and
copy/paste examples on how to find, run and monitor your applications,
and manage your data. In addition to how to optimize your workflow in
terms of filesystem traffic, memory usage etc.

The course is obligatory for all new Triton users and recommended to
all interested in the field.

**If you are not at Aalto University**, you can follow along with the
course and will probably learn something.  But, many of the examples
won't directly work on your cluster and you will need to adapt. Participants
from University of Helsinki can follow how to connect to their Kale/Ukko2
cluster by following instructions at: https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/it4sci/HPC++Winter+KICKSTART+2021

This course is part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University.



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course via Zoom (link sent to registered
participants).  The course is also streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the course.

**Registration:**

`Please register at this link <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuBRlKQ4X-ZVSUhoz8zLYSgAI5xH91Cg9hfkEHrjmerViy0Q/viewform>`__

Preparation
-----------

**Software installation**

* SSH client to connect to the cluster (+ be able to connect, see next
  point)

**Cluster account and connection verification**

* If you do not yet have access to Triton, :doc:`request an account
  </triton/accounts>` in advance. 
* Then, try to :doc:`connect to Triton </triton/tut/connecting>` to be
  ready.


**Mental preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending an online workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-online/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* `The Zoom mechanics we will use
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/>`__, might
  be useful to browse.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, to already become familiar with the content of the course.



Community standards
-------------------

We hope to make a good learning environment for everyone, and expect
everyone to do their part for this.  If there is anything we can do to
support that, let us know.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us right away* - if you need to
contact us privately, you can message the host on Zoom or
:doc:`contact us outside the course </help/index>`.  This could be as
simple as "speak louder / text on screen is unreadable / go slower" or
as complex as "someone is distracting our group by discussing too
advanced things".



Material
--------

* Material is linked within the schedule, but roughly covers the
  :ref:`Triton tutorials <tutorials>`.

Nov 22nd - Nov 25th 2022 / Python for Scientific Computing
==========================================================

.. admonition:: News and Important info

   * Livestream (join here): https://twitch.tv/coderefinery
   * Course material:
     https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/
   * During the event:

     * Open the livestream https://twitch.tv/coderefinery .  Watch
       this, this is the main "home base".
     * If you registered, open the HackMD notes link (this is used to
       ask questions).
     * Optional: If you registered for exercise sessions, open that Zoom
       session.  This is only active during exercise sessions, you
       will get instructions.

   * **News**

     * Day 3: Today was good, we went over the things as listed on the
       schedule.  Tomorrow we switch focuses to the use and reuse of
       software, not the programming itself.  This is still extremely
       useful and quite important for your future career, so even if
       days 1-3 were too simple *or* advanced, day 4 is for you!

     * Day 2: We did the lessons seen on the schedule.  There is no
       special preparation for tomorrow.

     * Day 1: we covered what was on the schedule (jupyter, pandas,
       matplotlib).  For day 2 preparation, try to fix any
       installation issues from day 1, go over the `basic Numpy
       lesson <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/numpy/>`__
       if the advanced was too complex, and optionally `read more
       about Tidy Data <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>`__.

     * 7/11: We have added the possibility to get 1 ECTS credit.

   * For more live updates, follow `Coderefinery Mastodon
     <https://fosstodon.org/@coderefinery>`__ (more updates) or
     `CodeRefine (not -ry) Twitter
     <https://twitter.com/coderefine/>`__ (fewer updates).

   * `Register here <https://link.webropolsurveys.com/EP/14BCB2E717A0CDA5>`__
     to get emails about the course, but it's not necessary to
     attend.  **The course is open to everyone in the world**, with
     some partners providing special services (see below).

   * Videos will be at `Twitch for 7 days immediately
     <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery/videos>`__ and `this YouTube
     playlist
     <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZLVmS9rf3nOm3xkYuInBWPUvS93sAUlk>`__

Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration. You do *not* need a
Twitch account.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the course.  Certain partners have extra registration possibilities
(in-person exercise rooms, Zoom for support).  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__.

**General registration (but check partner registration above):**
`Please register here <https://link.webropolsurveys.com/EP/14BCB2E717A0CDA5>`__.  While
the stream is available even without providing personal data, if you
register you may get HackMD access for asking questions and will
support our funding by contributing to our attendance statistics.



Credits
------- 

It is possible to obtain a certificate from the course with
a little extra work. The certificate is equivalent to 1 ECTS and your study
supervisor will be able to register it as a credit in your university study
credit system. Please make sure that your supervisor/study program accepts it.

Learners with a valid Aalto student number will automatically get the credit
registered in Aalto systems.

To obtain a certificate/credit, we expect you to have registered to the course by 25/11/2022, 
follow the 4 sessions and provide us with at least the following 5 documents via email
(1 text document, 4 or more python scripts/notebooks). 

- **1 text document** (PDF or txt or anything for text): For each of the 4 days, write a short paragraph (learning diary) to highlight
  your personal reflections about what you have found useful, which topic inspired
  you to go deeper, and more in general what you liked and what could be improved.
- **4 (or more) .py scripts/notebooks**: For each of the 4 days take one code example from the 
  course materials and make sure you can run it locally as a ".py" script or as a jupyter notebook.
  Modify it a bit according to what inspires you: adding more comments, testing the
  code with different inputs, expanding it with something related to your field of
  research. There is no right or wrong way of doing this, but please submit a
  python script/notebook that we are eventually able to run and test on our local computers.

These 5 (or more) documents should be sent before 31/December/2022 23:59CET to enrico.glerean@aalto.fi.
If the evaluation criteria are met for each of the 5 (or more) documents, you will receive
a certificate by mid January 2023. Please note that we do not track course attendance and if you missed one
session, recordings will be available on Twitch immediately after the streaming ends.

Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__.


**Software installation:**

* See the `installation page of the course material
  <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/installation/>`__.

  * In principle, if you are at Aalto, the service
    https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi should be sufficient to do most of
    this course without any local installations.  Perhaps not
    everything, but it will be OK for most people.

* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__, if you
  are registered for one of the exercise sessions.


**Mental preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending a livestream workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/>`__,
  good to read in detail.
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.



Community standards
-------------------

This is a large course, and we will have many diverse groups attending
it.  There will be people attending at all different levels, from
"just learned Python" to "been using Python for a while and want to
see some tips and tricks".  Everyone will choose their own path, some
people will be more hands-on or more "watching".  Everyone is be both
a teacher and a learner.  Even our instructors are always learning
things and make mistakes (and this is part of the point!).  Please
learn from our mistakes, too!

This course consists of both lectures, hands-on exercises, and demos.
It is designed to have a range of basic to advanced topics: there
should be something for everyone.

The main point this course is the exercises.  If you are with a group,
we hope people to work together and help each
other.  We expect everyone to help each other as best as they can with
respect for different levels of knowledge - at the same time be aware
of your own limitations.  No one is better than anyone else, we just
have different existing skills and backgrounds.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us* - HackMD is best.  If you need to contact us
privately, you can message the host on Zoom, instructor chat is via
`CodeRefinery chat <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/>`__,
and by email contact `CodeRefinery support
<https://coderefinery.org/>`__. This could be as simple as "speak
louder / text on screen is unreadable" or someone is creating a
harmful learning environment.


Code of Conduct
---------------
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching, 
and contributing. You can read our `Code of Conduct here <https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/>`__.
If you need to report any violation of the code of conduct, you can email the organisers at scip _at_ aalto.fi,
alternatively you can also use `this web form <https://indico.neic.no/event/183/surveys/47>`__.

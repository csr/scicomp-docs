Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University.

This is a medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It is suitable for people who have a basic
understanding of basic Python and want to know some internals and
important libraries for science.  Read the `learner personas <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#learner-personas>`__ to
see if the course is right for you

`Prerequisites
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__
include basic programming in Python.



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course via Zoom (link sent to registered
participants).  The course is also streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the course.  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__.

**Instructors and organizers:**

* Anne Claire Fouilloux, University of Oslo Department of Geosciences
* Naoe Tatara, University of Oslo Libraries **(local organizer)**
* Radovan Bast, University of Tromsø
* Richard Darst, Aalto Scientific Computing **(organizer)**
* Samantha Wittke, Finnish Geospatial Research Institute & Aalto University
* Thor Wikfeldt, EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden, Uppsala University

**Time, date, place:** the course consists of four online hands-on
sessions 3h each:

- Fri 11.sep, 15:30-16:30 **Installation help session**
- Mon 14.sep, 10:00-13:00 (Jupyter, numpy, matplotlib)
- Wed 16.sep, 10:00-13:00 (scripts, packaging)
- Mon 21.sep, 10:00-13:00 (scipy, pandas)
- Wed 23.sep, 10:00-13:00 (library ecosystem, dependencies, Binder)
- **Please connect to all sessions 10 minutes early**: icebreakers and
  intro already starts then.

**Registration:** This is on online workshop: we currently plan for
registrations via Zoom up to our capicity (for lectures+exercises,
priority for Aalto→Finland→Nordics), or Twitch (lectures, for anyone).
(Registration is now full, check back here for stream info.)

You may register as a **team**, and your team will be kept together
during exercise sessions within a breakout room.  If you come together
with your friends or research group, you will be able to learn a lot
more.  Even more so if you bring a helper with your group.

**Credits:** Certificates are not provided for this course.

Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__.

**Preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending an online workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-online/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* `The Zoom mechanics we will use
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/>`__, might
  be useful to browse.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.

Software installation:

* See the `installation page of the course material
  <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/installation/>`__.

  * In principle, if you are at Aalto, the service
    https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi should be sufficient to do most of
    this course without any local installations.  Perhaps not
    everything, but it will be OK for most people.

* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__.



Community standards
-------------------

This is a large course, and we will have many diverse groups attending
it.  Everyone will be both a teacher and a learner and help to make
the course successful.  Since this is a large and interactive course
which we are just now prototyping, there will be some rough edges and
not everything will go perfectly.  Please learn from our mistakes,
too!

This course consists of both lectures, hands-on exercises, and demos.
It is designed to have a range of basic to advanced topics: there
should be something for everyone.

The main point this course is the exercises, and they will happen in
breakout rooms where we expect people to work together and help each
other.  We expect everyone to help each other as best as they can with
respect for different levels of knowledge - at the same time be aware
of your own limitations.  No one is better than anyone else, we just
have different existing skills and backgrounds.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us* - if you need to contact us
privately, you can message the host on Zoom or :doc:`contact us
outside the course </help/index>`.  This could be as simple as "speak
louder / text on screen is unreadable" or someone is creating a
harmful learning environment.

News and notes
--------------

Week 37:

* Please see the installation instructions (link above).  You need to
  install anaconda *before* the first day, or else you will quickly
  fall behind.  This class is so large that we won't be able to do
  help you catch up.  You should also **verify your installation**
  (this is part of the installation instructions).  On the Friday
  before, we have an installation help session - you can join there
  for help.

* Please remember to join the meeting 10 minutes early.  Our
  icebreakers and introductions already start then.  If you are on
  time, you are late!

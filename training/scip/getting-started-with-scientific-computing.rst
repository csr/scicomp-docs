Feb 2022 / Getting started with scientific computing
====================================================

.. admonition:: Quick links

   * To register for the February 2022 sessions please visit https://link.webropol.com/s/introHPCJan2022
   * Continuation course for days 2-3: :doc:`winter-kickstart`
   * Twitch has videos for 14 days: https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery/videos

This course is a general introduction to computational researchers.
The point is to serve as a guide to your career: a map to the types of
resources that are available and skills you may need in your career,
so that you can be prepared when you
need more in the future.  There will also be topics related to using
these resources.  Aalto University is used in some examples, but all
parts are designed to be useful no matter where you are now.

This course is especially suitable to new researchers or students trying to
understand computational/data analysis options available to them.  It
won't go into anything too deep, but will provide you with a good
background for your next steps: you will know what resources are
available and know the next steps to use them.  The sibling course,
to use computer clusters, is :doc:`winter-kickstart`, and happens
together with this course.

Attending individual sessions is fine.

Other universities
------------------

This course is hosted at Aalto University but put on in cooperation
with many other universities. Anyone (even not at a partner site)
could get something out of this course.  **For the most part, this day's
events are not specific to any particular site and you can easily
adapt the lessons to wherever you may be now.**  If you want to help on
behalf of your site, contact us via the `CodeRefinery chat
<https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/>`__ (#workshops stream).



Schedule
--------

**All times EET, that is Europe/Helsinki time!**

- **Wed, 2 February 2022**

  - **11:50--12:00: Connecting time, introductions, icebreakers**

  - **12:00--12:25: Me and HPC or: How I learned to stop worrying
    and love the computing.**

    Are you at the start of your scientific computing journey?

    Would you like to hear tips and tricks from someone who knows
    what they are doing, but still remembers what it was like to
    be a newbie?

    In this talk a we will get a personal views of high-performance
    computing from a final year PhD student and one of our staff
    scientists.

  - **12:25--12:50: Scientific Computing workflows at Aalto**

    The types of services available at Aalto and many other
    universities, a summary of what you might actually use in the next
    six months.

    - Material: https://hackmd.io/@AaltoSciComp/SciCompIntro
    - Material: :doc:`/triton/usage/workflows`
    - Breakout rooms for other sites (as available).

  - **13:00--13:25: When and how to ask for help** (Radovan Bast, UiT, Norway)

    It's dangerous to go alone, take us!  Don't waste time struggling,
    there are plenty of people here for you.

    - Slides: https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/bast/help-with-supercomputers/main/talk.md/

  - **13:25--13:50: A tour of scientific computing skills and
    tools**

    There are so many tools available for computing.  We'll describe
    some of most important things and give you links to your next
    steps.

    - Material: https://hackmd.io/@AaltoSciComp/ToolsOfScientificComputing

  - **14:00--14:50: Q&A/panel discussion (on any topic)**

  - **15:00--15:45: Connecting to a HPC cluster as part of**
    :doc:`winter-kickstart`

    - Required if you are attending the Triton/HPC tutorials the
      following days.
    - 15:00--15:20?: Livestream introduction to connecting
    - 15:??--??: Individual help time in Zoom (links sent to
      registered participants)
    - Material: :doc:`/triton/tut/connecting`



Varying topics
--------------

Each year, this course is offered with varying topics.  We recommend
you review these topics we have covered in previous courses (which we
won't cover again during this course).  You can ask questions on these
during these sessions:

* Linux shell crash course: :doc:`reading </scicomp/shell>`, `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXLbtaxpdI&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nN_tMPgqoUQac9bTjZw8JYc&index=3>`__
* Git crash course `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9AT7MqmLrU&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nPFw29oKUj6w1QdsTCECS1S&index=6>`__



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  Registering will get
you information from the organizers and a Zoom link for further Q&A
and discussion.  There will also be an anonymous HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the lectures.

**Instructors and organizers:**

* Richard Darst
* Enrico Glerean
* Simo Tuomisto
* ... and you?

**Registration:**

`Please register at this link <https://link.webropol.com/s/introHPCJan2022>`__
Registration is not required to just watch online, lurkers welcome.
Registration will get you ("*" indicates priority for Finnish academic
members):

- Email reminders and summaries each day.
- The HackMD link, so that you can ask questions (this is very
  important for interactivity!)(*)
- Zoom links for the per-university breakout rooms (*)


**Credits:** Certificates are not provided for this course.

**Additional course info at:** scip@aalto.fi



Preparation / prerequisites
---------------------------

**Software installation:**

* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__ (if
  attending breakout rooms)


**Background knowledge:** Just come with what you know, there is
something for everyone.  It might be good to look at the "varying
topics" material, especially the shell crash course one.


**Mental preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending an online workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* `The Zoom mechanics we will use
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/>`__, might
  be useful to browse.




Community standards
-------------------

We hope to make a good learning environment for everyone, and expect
everyone to do their part for this.  If there is anything we can do to
support that, let us know.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us right away* - if you need to
contact us privately, you can message the host on Zoom or
:doc:`contact us outside the course </help/index>`.  This could be as
simple as "speak louder / text on screen is unreadable / go slower" or
as complex as "someone is distracting our group by discussing too
advanced things".

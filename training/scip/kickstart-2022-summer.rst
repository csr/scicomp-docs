       Finland) can give you credits for topics including what we
       learned here.

   - Day 1 summary: We covered a bunch of high-level topics for new
     researchers, see the playlist.  For day 2 (Thursday), make sure
     you can connect to the cluster - see the schedule for details.
   - Day 2 summary: We did what was on the schedule.  There was a lot
     of discussion in the sessions, recordings show the discussion +
     solutions to the exercises.  No extra preparation needed for
     tomorrow, but the hands-on work gets more involved and
     interesting.
   - Day 3 summary: we looked at different ways to make computation
     faster by parallelizing it, not at the level of writing new
     parallel code but using parallel code.  We heard from CSC.

Kickstart is a three Ã— half day course for researchers to get
started with high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
**The first day serves as a guide to your career:** a map to the types of
resources that are available and skills you may need in your career,
so that you can be prepared when you
need more in the future.  This part is especially suitable to new researchers or students trying to
understand computational/data analysis options available to them.  It
won't go into anything too deep, but will provide you with a good
background for your next steps: you will know what resources are
available and know the next steps to use them.

**The second and third days take
you from being a new user to being competent to run your code at a
larger scale than you could before.**
This part is good for any researcher who thinks they may need to
scale up to larger resources in the next six months, in any field.
Even if you don't use computing clusters, you will be better prepared
to understand how computing works on other systems.  If you are a
student, this is an investment in your skills.  By the end of the course you
get the hints, ready solutions and
copy/paste examples on how to find, run and monitor your applications,
and manage your data.

If you are at Aalto University: the course is obligatory for all new
Triton users and recommended to all interested in the field.

This course is part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University, supported by many others outside Aalto, and offered to others as part of `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`__.



Other universities
------------------

**If you are not at Aalto University**, you can follow along with the
course and will learn many things anyway.  The course is designed to
be as useful to people outside of Aalto, but some of the examples
won't directly work on your cluster (most will, anyway we will give
hints about adapting).  Known sites partnering with this course:

* Regardless of where you are from, you may register using the
  registration form below to get emails about the course.
* Participants from University of Helsinki can follow how to connect
  to their Kale/Turso cluster by following `their own instructions
  <https://wiki.helsinki.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=408323613>`__.
* Participants from University of Oulu: please follow instructions on
  `how to access the Carpo2 computing cluster <https://ict.oulu.fi/17120/?page&lang=en>`__.
* Tampere: this course is recommended for all new Narvi users and also all
  interested in HPC. Most things should work with simply replacing triton
  -> narvi. Some differences in configuration are listed in
  `Narvi differences
  <https://narvi-docs.readthedocs.io/narvi/kickstart-diffs.html>`__
* `CSC <https://csc.fi>`__ (Finland): Participants with `CSC user
  account <https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/>`__ can try examples also in
  CSC supercomputers, see the `overview of CSC supercomputers
  <https://docs.csc.fi/computing/overview/>`__ for details on
  connecting, etc.

needed!  This is the primary way to watch all sessions.  **Zoom** is
used for exercise sessions of partner audiences, and **HackMD** is
used for a continuous Q&A session.

**Time, date:**  7 and 9-10 June (Tue, Thu-Fri). 11:50-16:00 EEST

**Place:** Online via public livestream, Zoom exercise sessions for
partners.

**Registration:** Please register at this link https://link.webropol.com/s/scicompintrosummer2022. Attending individual sessions is fine.

**Cost:** Free of charge for FGCI consortium members including Aalto
employees and students.  Livestream is free to everyone.

**Additional course info at:** scip@aalto.fi



Schedule
--------

**All times are EEST (Europe/Helsinki time)!**

The daily schedule will be adjusted based on the audience's questions.
There will be frequent breaks and continuous questions time going on,
this is the mass equivalent of an informal help session to get you
started with the computing resources.


.. admonition:: Subject to change

   Schedule may still have minor updates, please check back for
   the latest.

* **Day #1 (Tue 7.jun):** Basics and background

  * 11:50--12:00: Connecting time, basics, and icebreaker

  * **12:00--12:10 Introduction, about the course** *Richard Darst and
    other staff* Materials: :doc:`../../training/kickstart/intro`

  * **12:10--12:25: From data storage to your science** *Enrico
    Glerean and Simo Tuomisto*

    Data is how most computational work starts, whether it is
    externally collected, simulation code, or generated.  And these
    days, you can work on data even remotely, and these workflows
    aren't obvious.  We discuss how data storage choices lead to
    computational workflows. Materials: `SciComp Intro
    <https://hackmd.io/@AaltoSciComp/SciCompIntro>`__

  * **12:25--12:50: What is parallel computing?  An analogy with
    cooking** *Enrico Glerean and Thomas Pfau*

    In workshops such as this, you will hear lots about parallel
    computing and how you need it, but rarely get a understandable
    introduction to how they relate and which are right for you.
    Here, we give a understandable metaphor with preparing large
    meals.  `Slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQLTzWkRy7Du3jjPJ6Y9BqKczU_JcSTEL6XsndrNJ7ylzi4RWeEy8lhfWZQu_lpwbAKroh51qqLoPFG/pub>`__

  * **13:00--13:25: Behind the scenes: the humans of scientific
    computing** *Richard Darst and ???*

    Who are we that provide these services.  What makes it such a
    fascinating career?  Learn about what goes on behind the scenes
    and how you could join us.

  * **13:25--13:50: How you actually install software on the cluster:
    an example case (Conda and Python)** *Simo Tuomisto and ???*

    Software installation is one of the questions we most often get.
    Usually, on clusters, this happens via *environments*, which
    allows you to install specific software per-project.  We'll give a
    demonstration of how these work in Python. Materials for demo:
    :doc:`/triton/apps/python-conda`

  - **14:00--14:50: Secure Shell (ssh) tips and tricks** *Thomas Pfau
    and Enrico Glerean*

    Remembering server address... Another login? Another password prompt? 
    Again? Wouldn't it be nice to just have a key instead of a keycode that
    you need to type in? Here, we will show you how to set up your computer
    to easily connect to the server(s) you need. And we will explain the 
    process from keys to config.  While useful, this part is skippable if 
    you are able to connect to Triton (next section).
    Materials: :doc:`/scicomp/ssh`

  - **15:00--15:45: Connecting to a HPC cluster** *Thomas Pfau and
    Simo Tuomisto*

    - Required if you are attending the Triton/HPC tutorials the
      following days, otherwise the day is done.
    - 15:00--15:20?: Livestream introduction to connecting
    - 15:??--??: Individual help time in Zoom (links sent to
      registered participants)
    - Material: :doc:`/triton/tut/connecting`

  - Preparation for day 2:

    Remember to read/watch the "shell crash course" (see "Preparation"
    below) if you are not yet confident with the command line.  This
    will be useful for tomorrow.

* **Day #2 (Thu 9.jun):** Basic use of a cluster *(Richard Darst, Simo
  Tuomisto)*

  - 11:50--12:00: Connecting time and icebreaker

  - **12:00--12:05: Introduction to days 2-3**

    - :doc:`/triton/tut/intro`

  - **12:05--12:30: What can you do with a computational cluster?**

    Several real examples of how people use the cluster (what you can
    do at the end of the course).

    - Real example 1: Large-scale computing with array jobs
    - Real example 2: Large-scale parallel computing

  - **12:30--15:00: Running your first jobs in the queue**

    - :doc:`/triton/tut/interactive`
    - :doc:`/triton/tut/serial`
    - :doc:`/triton/tut/monitoring`

  - **15:00--15:30: Other things you should know about the HPC environment**

    - :doc:`/triton/tut/modules`
    - :doc:`/triton/tut/storage`
    - :doc:`/triton/tut/remotedata`

  - **15:30--16:00: Q&A**

* **Day #3 (Fri 10.jun):** Advanced cluster use *(Simo Tuomisto, Richard
  Darst)*

  - 11:50: Joining time/icebreaker

  - **11:50--13:00: Simple parallelization with array jobs:**
    :doc:`/triton/tut/array`

  - **13:00--14:00: Using more than one CPU at the same time:**
    :doc:`/triton/tut/parallel`

  - **14:00--14:30: Laptops to Lumi**

    You now know of basics of using a computing cluster.  What if you
    need more than what a university can provide?  CSC (and other
    national computing centers) have even more resources, and this is
    a tour of them. `Slides here <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/scicomp-docs/raw/master/training/scip/CSC-services_062022.pdf>`__.

  - **14:40--15:30: Running jobs that can utilize GPU hardware:** :doc:`/triton/tut/gpu`

  - **15:30--16:00: Q&A**



Preparation
-----------

We strongly recommend you are familiar with the Linux command line.
Browsing the following material is sufficient:

* `Basic Linux shell and scripting
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXLbtaxpdI&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nN_tMPgqoUQac9bTjZw8JYc&index=3>`__
  (important) (or read/watch the shorter :doc:`crash course
  </scicomp/shell>` / `video <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__)

**How to attend:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending a livestream workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.




Technical prerequisites
-----------------------

**Software installation**

* SSH client to connect to the cluster (+ be able to connect, see next
  point)
* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__ (if
  attending breakout rooms)


**Cluster account and connection verification:**

* Access to your computer cluster.

  * Aalto: if you do not yet have access to Triton, :doc:`request an account
    </triton/accounts>` in advance.

* Then, connect and get it working

  * Aalto (and possibly useful to others): try to :doc:`connect to
    Triton </triton/tut/connecting>` to be ready.  Come to the
    Wednesday session for help connecting (required).



Next steps / follow-up courses
------------------------------

Keep the :doc:`Triton quick reference </triton/ref/index>` close (or
equivalent for your cluster).

Each year the first day has varying topics presented.  We don't repeat
these every year, but we strongly recommend that you watch some of
these videos yourself as preparation.

Very strongly recommended:

* `When and how to ask for help
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgXXz3fzdM>`__ (very useful)
* `Git intro
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9AT7MqmLrU&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nOaNzGrzPwLtkvFLu35kVF4&index=5>`__ (useful)

Other useful material in previous versions of this course:

* Scientific Computing workflows at Aalto - concepts apply to other
  sites, too (optional): `lecture notes
  <https://hackmd.io/@AaltoSciComp/SciCompIntro>`__ and `video
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz37XAzWFhk>`__, :doc:`reference
  material </triton/usage/workflows>`.
* Tools of scientific computing (optional): `lecture notes
  <https://hackmd.io/@AaltoSciComp/ToolsOfScientificComputing>`__ and
  `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYfxXEb0Go>`__

While not an official part of this course, we suggest these videos
(co-produced by our staff) as a follow-up perspective:

* Attend a `CodeRefinery workshop <https://coderefinery.org>`__,
  which teaches more useful tools for scientific software
  development.
* Look at `Hands-on Scientific Computing
  <https://hands-on.coderefinery.org>`__ for an online course to
  either browse or take for credits.
* `Cluster Etiquette (in Research Software Hour)
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIW9mqDwnJE&list=PLpLblYHCzJAB6blBBa0O2BEYadVZV3JYf>`__:
  The Summer Kickstart teaches what you *can* do from this course,
  but what *should* you do to be a good user.
* `How to tame the cluster (in Research Software Hour)
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HN9-MW7Tw8&list=PLpLblYHCzJAB6blBBa0O2BEYadVZV3JYf>`__.
  This mostly repeats the contents of this course, with a bit more
  discussion, and working one example from start to parallel.



Community standards
-------------------

We hope to make a good learning environment for everyone, and expect
everyone to do their part for this.  If there is anything we can do to
support that, let us know.

If there is anything wrong, *tell us right away* - if you need to
contact us privately, you can message the host on Zoom or
:doc:`contact us outside the course </help/index>`.  This could be as
simple as "speak louder / text on screen is unreadable / go slower" or
as complex as "someone is distracting our group by discussing too
advanced things".

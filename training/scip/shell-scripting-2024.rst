====================================
January 2024 / Linux Shell Scripting
====================================

Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Anyone with intermediate or advanced level in Linux shell.

**About the course:** You might have already used Linux shell commands interactively, but how do you go from interactive terminal use to non-interactive workflow with scripts? This course is oriented on those who want to start using BASH programming fully and use terminal efficiently.

We expect that course participants are familiar with the :doc:`shell basics <linux-shell-basics>` (experience with BASH, ZSH, etc). We somewhat touch the `Part 1 of the Linux Shell tutorial <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/linux-shell/>`__, and continue to Part 2. Though we expect that participant knows how to create a directory and can edit file from the linux shell command line. We will be scripting a lot, there will be lots of demos and real practicing.

**Lecturer:** Ivan Degtyarenko, D. Sc., Science IT / Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University

**Place:** Online and in-person at Room U135a (U7) Otaniemi (in-person only if there are enough participants). Please register for receiving the link to streaming and other infos for in-person sessions.

**Credits and certificates:** We do not provide credits or certificates for this course.

**Setup instructions:** For the online course we expect you to have Zoom client installed on your local workstation/laptop. Then we expect you to have access to Linux-like shell terminal. `You can check BASH installation instructions for various operating systems at this link <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/intro-linux-aalto-computing/#preparation>`__. If needed participants can be provided with access to the Triton HPC cluster for running examples.

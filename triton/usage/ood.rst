Open OnDemand
=============

.. _ood:

Open OnDemand is a web-based interface to computer clusters.  It
provides a low-threshold way to do easy work and shell access to do
more.  It complements, not replaces, the traditional ssh access: just
like with Jupyter, it may help you get started, but most people will
eventually move towards shell access (even if that shell is via Open
OnDemand).



Connecting
----------

Address: http://ondemand.triton.aalto.fi .  Log in with the usual Aalto
login.  A pre-existing :doc:`Triton account <../accounts>`
is needed.



How to use
----------

The first view is a dashboard that provides an interface to a number
of applications:

* Shell: Top bar → Clusters → Triton shell access.  Or via the file
  manager.
* Files: Top bar → Files → choose your directory.  You can upload and
  download files this way.
* Jupyter: Top bar → Interactive apps → Jupyter
* Other applications via the main page or Top bar → Interactive Apps →
  (choose).



Applications
------------

Once logged in, there are ways to start separate applications, for
example Jupyter.  These run as separate, independent processes.

We have these applications available and supported:

* Triton shell access (Shell access, just like SSH)
* Triton desktop (run any graphical application)
* Jupyter
* RStudio
* Matlab
* VS Code Server (coming...)

Choose partition 'interactive' (if it asks you) and a correct account.

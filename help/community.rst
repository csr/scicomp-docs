SciComp community
=================

Let's face it: we learn more from each other than from classes.  There
is a major problem with inequality in computational sciences, a large
part is related to how we learn these tools.  Join the Aalto
Scientific Computing community to help you and others be the best
scientist you can be.  You can

* Network with others within a supportive mentoring community.

* Share knowledge among ourselves, avoid wasting time on things where
  someone knows the answer.

* Take part in developing our services - basically, be a voice of the
  users.



SciComp Garage and issues
-------------------------

Currently, most of our interaction happens in the daily :doc:`SciComp
Garage <garage>`, which is a daily meeting where we help others (and
learn ourselves).  If you hang out there, you will learn a lot.

If you subscribe to the `Triton issue tracker
<https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__, you
will see a lot of questions and answers, and thus learn a lot.



Aalto community chats
---------------------

We have weekly chats for the Aalto scientific computing
poweruser/RSEs as a way to network with the community and Aalto staff.
Currently, these are done at `10:00 on Thursdays as part of
the Nordic-RSE Finland chats
<https://nordic-rse.org/communities/finland/>`__.  Anyone is welcome
to join and discuss Aalto-related topics.



Mailing lists
-------------

* If you have a :doc:`Triton account </triton/index>`, you are on the
  triton-users mailing list already.  Many :doc:`training
  </training/index>` and other events are announced there.
* If you do not have a Triton account, the :doc:`scicomp-announcements
  mailing list </training/scicomp-announcements-maillist>` provides
  the same information.  `Subscribe
  here <https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/scicomp-announcements>`__.
* Join `our Research Software Engineer mailing list
  <https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/rse>`__ for information on
  research software related topics and the RSE community at Aalto,
  possibly including discussion and internal job advertisements.



Chat
----

* Join the `Aalto Scientific Computing group on Aalto Microsoft Teams
  <asc-teams_>`__.  The invite code is ``e50tyij``.  In practice, we
  watch it for questions but it's not the most active place (but it
  could be).
* We often hang out on the `CodeRefinery chat
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/>`__, and there is an
  ``#aalto`` stream there.

Long-term archival
==================

Long-term archival is important to make sure that you have ability to
access your group's own data in the long term. Aalto resources are not
currently intended for long-term archival. There are other resources
available for this, such as

-  the EU-funded `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`__ for open published
   data (embargoed data and closed data is also somewhat supported).
-  Finland's `IDA <https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/>`__ (for large data,
   closed or open). There are :doc:`Aalto-specific instructions
   for IDA here <../data/ida>`.
-  There is supposed to be an alternate `Finnish digital preservation
   service <https://www.fairdata.fi/en/fairdata-pas/>`__ coming in
   2017, and it's unclear what the intention of IDA is in light of that.

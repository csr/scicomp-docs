Science-IT (Aalto HPC)
======================

**Science-IT** is the formal name of the project which provides the
Triton computational cluster.  It is funded by Aalto University,
departments and schools, and the Academy of Finland.  Perhaps a better
description would be **Aalto HPC** (high-performance computing).

Science-IT is the "legal representation" of Aalto Scientific Computing
within Aalto.

Computational research is one of the focus areas in Aalto
University. The Science-IT project was founded in 2009 to facilitate
the computational infrastructure needed in top-tier scientific
research. Many Centres of Excellence and departments at Aalto
University are using our resources with great success. There are
many.  Science-IT is administered
from the School of Science, and direct Aalto level funding enables use
of our resources from all Aalto University, free of charge.


Our services
------------

In Science-IT, we concentrate on mid-range computing and special
resources needed by researchers in the School of Science. With local
resources, we can provide high-quality support and even
research-project-level customization.  Because our resources are
integrated into the Aalto IT environment, with regular local training
in the scientific computing practice to entry-level users, our
resources enjoy an ease of access and lower barrier to entry than, for
example, CSC HPC resources. We are also a basic research
infrastructure, enabling the integration of separately purchased
resources to our cluster and storage environments, with dedicated
access for the purchaser.


Membership
----------

Departments and schools can join the Science-IT project and receive a
share of our resources and dedicated staff support.  Please contact
Mikko Hakala for details.
